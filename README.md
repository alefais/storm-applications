# storm-applications

This repository contains a collection of applications implemented with [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/). Applications can be run in local mode, further information can be found in each application README.

This work is based upon [briskstream project](https://github.com/ShuhaoZhangTony/briskstream) and a [collection of real-time applications](https://github.com/mayconbordin/storm-applications).

An implementation of these applications with [Apache Flink](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/) is provided and can be found in the [flink-applications repo](https://github.com/alefais/flink-applications) .
